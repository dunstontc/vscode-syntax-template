## Intro

G D Em D
Am G D

## Verse 1
`G`   `D`               `Em`

Sometimes, you look the same

`D`           `Am`           `G`      `D`
Just like you did before the accident

`G`         `D`          `Em`
When you're starin' into space

     `D`     `Am`              `G`
It's hard to believe you don't remember it


Woke up in the ambulance

You pieced it all together on the drive



## Chorus

I know you don't remember calling me

But I told you even then

you looked so pretty

In a hospital bed, I remember you said

You were scared

And so was I
